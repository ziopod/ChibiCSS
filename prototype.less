/**
* Content prototyping
*
* “ Content precedes design.
*   Design in the absence of content is not design, it's decoration. ”
*   — Mark Boulton, May 2008
*
* The goal of this file is to provide a neutral design to improve content
* readability. The idea is to import this file, work on content, remove this
* file and finally do your design whit a better comfort.
